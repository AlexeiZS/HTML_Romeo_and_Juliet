	<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<p><b>ACT1</b></p>
<p><b>PROLOGUE</b></p>
Two households, bolt alice in dignity,<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of start-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
Which, but their childern's end, nought could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here ahall miss, our toul shall strive to mend.<br>
<p><b>SCENE I.Verona.A public place.</b><p>
<i><small>Enter SAMSON and GREOGRY, of hte hourse of Capulet,
armed with swords and bucklers</small></i>
<p><b>SAMSON</b></p>
No,for then we should be colliers.<br>
